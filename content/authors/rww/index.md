I am an Associate Professor of Quantitative Methods in the Atkinson Graduate School of Management at Willamette University.   My research interests include panel/cross-sectional time series data, causal inference in observed populations (joint with Tim Johnson), political economy, and general applied statistics and statistical computing. I am also an Honorary Instructor at the University of Essex where I lecture annually in the Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis.  I have held previous appointments at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Texas A&M University, Washington University in Saint Louis, and Rice University.  With Curt Signorino and Muhammet Bas, I was awarded the Warren Miller Prize for *Statistical Backwards Induction* for the best article in *Political Analysis*.

Of greatest import, I am married to the love of my life, am the proud father of two wonderful sons, like the Pacific Northwest, and, to keep things in balance, am a lifelong [Arsenal](http://www.arsenal.co.uk/) fan.
